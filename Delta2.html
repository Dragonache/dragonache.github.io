<h2>Facts about the Danube Delta</h2><br>
<p>This is the end of the Danube River and is the second largest river delta in Europe next to the Volga River one&#8230; but the Danube is better preserved.&nbsp; The Danube Delta can be found mostly in Romania with a bit of it <a href="https://www.meganstarr.com/places-visit-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>The Delta has three channels: <em>Chilia, Sulina, and Sfantu Gheorghe</em>.&nbsp; The <em>Chilia branch</em> is the youngest and most vigorous and a lot of it lies within Ukraine.&nbsp; The <em>Sulina branch</em> is the central branch and its course has changed several times over history- a lot as a result of man.&nbsp; And the <em>Sfantu Gheorghe branch</em> is the southern branch and the most sparsely populated.&nbsp; The Danube eventually flows into the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve is actually home to one of the greatest ecosystems in the world and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&nbsp; There are even over 300 species of birds recorded in the Delta.&nbsp; It has the third largest biodiversity in the world next to Australia&#8217;s Great Barrier Reef and Ecuador&#8217;s Galapagos Islands, respectively.</p>
